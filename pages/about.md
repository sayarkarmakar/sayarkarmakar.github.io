description: Sayar Karmakar is an AP in UFlorida; research in time-series analysis
---

I joined University of Florida as an Assistant Professor of Statistics in Fall 2018. I received a Ph.D. from the
[Department of Statistics](http://www.galton.uchicago.edu)
at the University of Chicago prior to that.

My primary research interests lie in developing novel methods related to time series. Time-varying model analysis in different contexts and strong Gaussian approximations were the two main themes of my dissertation. Apart from these, I also got interested in some forecasting problems. After graduating, I have focused on some new areas such as shape-restricted regression problems, change-point estimation problem, multiple hypothesis testing under spatial dependence, scan/multiscale statistics etc. Very recently I have veered into network analysis and have grown multi-directional interest in this vast topic. Before starting my PhD, I also worked on robust statistics and genetics. 

I received my undergraduate degree [B.Stat.](http://www.isical.ac.in/)
in 2011, from Indian Statistical Institute, Kolkata and my masters degree [M.Stat.] from the same instituition in 2013, with a specialization in Mathematical Statistics and Probability.
