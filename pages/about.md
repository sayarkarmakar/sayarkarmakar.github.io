I joined University of Florida as an Assistant Professor of Statistics in Fall 2018. I received a Ph.D. from the
[Department of Statistics](http://www.galton.uchicago.edu)
at the University of Chicago. 

My primary research interests lie in developing novel methods realted to dependent data. Time-varying model analysis in different contexts and strong Gaussian approximations were the two main themes of my dissertation. After graduating, I have been focused on some new areas such as shape-restricted regression problems, change-point estimation problem, multiple hypothesis testing under spatial dependence, scan/multiscale statistics etc.

I received my undergraduate degree [B.Stat.](http://www.isical.ac.in/)
in 2011, from Indian Statistical Institute, Kolkata and my masters degree [M.Stat.] from the same instituition in 2013, with a specialization in Mathematical Statistics and Probability.
