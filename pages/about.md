description: Sayar Karmakar is graduate stdudent in Department of Statistics at University of Wisconsin - Madison; research in time-series analysis
---

I am a Ph.D. candidate in the
[Department of Statistics](http://www.galton.uchicago.edu)
at the University of Chicago. My primary research interests lie in developing novel methods realted to dependent data. Time-varying model analysis in different contexts and strong Gaussian approximations are the two main themes of my dissertation until now. Recently I am focusing on the little studied topic of weak dependence in High-dimensional statistics mostly from the perspective of prediction in different contexts. 

I received my undergraduate degree [B.Stat](http://www.isical.ac.in/)
in 2011, from Indian Statistical Institute, Kolkata and my masters degree [M.Stat] from the same instituition in 2013, with a specialization in Mathematical Statistics and Probability.
