description: Sayar Karmakar is an AP in UFlorida; research in time-series analysis
---

I studied B.Stat and M.Stat at Indian Statistical Institute, Kolkata and went on to pursue a PhD in Statistics at the University of Chicago. After graduation, I joined the Statistics department at University of Florida as an Assistant Professor. My main research interests lie in exploring different forms of dependence present in the data. Over the past few years, I am working on different projects in multiple time series, time-varying models, econometrics and neural networks. I have served as a referee for leading journals in Statistics and Econometrics and I was recently appointed as an Early Career Advisory Board member at the Journal of Multivariate Analysis. I am thankful to NSF, AMS Simons and UF Informatics Institute for partially supporting my research.
