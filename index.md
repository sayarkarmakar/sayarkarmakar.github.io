<h2> Recent Updates</h2>
Dec 2020: Our [Paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2009.06007) got a revision request from Bayesian Analysis. 

Dec 2020: We submitted a paper on model-free predictions for econometric datasets. Here we explored a popular model-free prediction based on NoVas transformation for long-horizon prediction and proposed new methods to boost this in diverse scenario.

Nov 2020: Our [Paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2011.13157)  "Simultaneous inference for time-varying models" is now accepted in Journal of Econometrics. 

Oct 2020: Peer-reviewed conference article on cyberbullying gets accepted at HICSS (Hawaii International Conference on System Science) 54. An initial work on change-point exploration was also accepted in 16th Annual social informatics research symposium back in Aug 2020.

Oct 2020: Interesting work has begun on Neural nets convergence, some related new algorithms and their tail properties. We look forward to apply these new algorithms in time-series forecasting.

Sep 2020: We submitted a [Paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2009.06007) on time-varying Bayesian ARCH/GARCH model. Here a new B-spline based estimation method is proposed and posterior contraction theory is developed. We were also able to include iGARCH model, which is a first.

Aug 2020: We established posterior contraction theory for time-varying models on Poisson count series. This [Paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2009.07634)  adds a theoretical proof of the method we proposed in a paper from April analyzing initial Covid-19 counts.

June 2020: A new project has begun where we focus on spatial patterns in US states Covid-19 counts. In this paper we propose an alternative method of R0 estimation which uses only the time-series data on incidence rate only.

May 2020: A new paper on shrinkage estimators with singular prior is submitted.

April 2020: A Bayesian time-varying model is used to analyze initial Covid-19 propagation across different countries

April 2020: We got a RR from Advances in Applied Probability for our [Paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2002.05577)  on "Regular Stochastic Block Model". This is currently being revised.
