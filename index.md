<h2> Upcoming invited talks </h2>
Some of my recent and upcoming invited talks are [here](https://sayarkarmakar.github.io/pages/talks.html)

<h2> Recent Updates</h2>
August 2021: I was awarded an NSF DMS grant in their ATD program. Awa√ürd Title: New algorithms for inference and predictions on large geospatial datasets. 2021-24. Role- Solo P.I. \$200,000

July 2021: Our [Paper](https://sayarkarmakar.github.io/publications/hpctimeseries.pdf) on time-series based classifier for HPC based malware detection is now accepted at IEEE International Symposium on Hardware Oriented Security and Trust (HOST) (Acceptance rate 28/130)

June 2021: We submitted a [Paper](https://sayarkarmakar.github.io/publications/guaranteesfullpaper.pdf) on stochastic neurotron and its convergence guarantee.

June 2021: I was awarded an AMS Simons Travel Grant for 2021-2024. 

May 2021: We submitted a paper on Forecasting output growth of Advanced economies where gold market volatility is used as a proxy of global uncertainty. This is a joint work with Aseef Salisu, Rangan Gupta and Sonali Das. [Paper](https://ideas.repec.org/p/cth/wpaper/gru_2021_017.html)


April 2021: Our [Paper](https://doi.org/10.1214/21-EJS1851) is now accepted at Electronic Journal of Statistics.

Mar 2021: Our [Paper](https://doi.org/10.1214/21-BA1267) is now accepted at Bayesian Analysis.

Mar 2021: Inducted into Early Career Advisory Board for Journal of Multivariate Analysis. First such experience of being part of an editorial board team! 

I also accepted an invitation to serve as a Program Committee Member at CYBER- Sixth International Conference on Cyber-Tenchologies and Cyber-Systems

Feb 2021: Our [Paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2012.08223) "Long-term prediction intervals with many covariates" got a revision request from Journal of Time-series Analysis.

Jan 2021: Our [Paper](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jmva.2021.104726) "Shrinkage Estimation with Singular Priors and an Application to Small Area Estimation" is now accepted in Journal of Multivariate Analysis. 

Jan 2021: We submitted a [Paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2005.04211) where we proposed some algorithms with provable guarantees on depth-2 neural nets. 

Jan 2021: We submitted a [Paper](../publications/sayarmodelfree.pdf) on model-free predictions for econometric datasets. Here we explored a popular model-free prediction based on NoVas transformation for long-horizon prediction and proposed new methods to boost this in diverse scenario.


Dec 2020: We resubmitted [Paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2002.05577) on "Regular Stochastic Block Model"

Dec 2020: Our [Paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2009.06007) got a revision request from Bayesian Analysis. We submitted the revision.


Nov 2020: Our [Paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2011.13157)  "Simultaneous inference for time-varying models" is now accepted in Journal of Econometrics. 

Oct 2020: Peer-reviewed conference article on cyberbullying gets accepted at HICSS (Hawaii International Conference on System Science) 54. An initial work on change-point exploration was also accepted in 16th Annual social informatics research symposium back in Aug 2020.

Oct 2020: Interesting work has begun on Neural nets convergence, some related new algorithms and their tail properties. We look forward to apply these new algorithms in time-series forecasting.

Sep 2020: We submitted a [Paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2009.06007) on time-varying Bayesian ARCH/GARCH model. Here a new B-spline based estimation method is proposed and posterior contraction theory is developed. We were also able to include iGARCH model, which is a first.

Aug 2020: We established posterior contraction theory for time-varying models on Poisson count series. This [Paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2009.07634)  adds a theoretical proof of the method we proposed in a paper from April analyzing initial Covid-19 counts.

Aug 2020: Our [Paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2001.10164) was presented in JSM 2020 in Statistica Sinica invited session. Only 3 published papers in SS between 2018-20 were selected for this distinction.

June 2020: A new project has begun where we focus on spatial patterns in US states Covid-19 counts. In this paper we propose an alternative method of R0 estimation which uses only the time-series data on incidence rate only.

May 2020: A new paper on shrinkage estimators with singular prior is submitted.

April 2020: A Bayesian time-varying model is used to analyze initial Covid-19 propagation across different countries

April 2020: We got a RR from Advances in Applied Probability for our [Paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2002.05577)  on "Regular Stochastic Block Model". This is currently being revised.

May 2021: We submitted a paper on Boosting Hardware Malware detection using time-series based classifiers. This is a joint work with Kanad Basu and Abraham Kuruvilla (Graduate student).
